# Map Features Implementation

This document outlines the new map-based travel planning features that have been implemented.

## üó∫Ô∏è Features Implemented

### 1. **Mapbox Integration**
- **Dark Theme Map**: Uses `mapbox://styles/mapbox/dark-v10` for the futuristic dark city visuals
- **3D View**: Set to `pitch={45}` for pseudo-3D immersion with building extrusions
- **Interactive Canvas**: Full-screen map workspace for travel planning

### 2. **Floating Preview Cards**
- **Rich Information Display**: Each trip node shows as a floating card with:
  - Node type icons (üè® lodging, üçΩÔ∏è restaurant, üéØ activity, etc.)
  - Title, description, rating, price
  - Address, phone, website links
  - Expandable details
- **Interactive Elements**: 
  - Click to select/expand
  - Edit mode for updating information
  - Delete functionality
  - Draggable positioning

### 3. **Whiteboard Drawer**
- **Creative Planning**: Side panel with drawing/sketch capabilities
- **Sticky Notes**: Color-coded notes with different types (Note, Idea, Reminder)
- **Drag & Drop**: Double-click notes to drop them onto the map as new nodes
- **Visual Organization**: Free-form brainstorming space

### 4. **State Management**
- **Zustand Store**: Centralized state management for:
  - Trip nodes and connections
  - Map viewport settings
  - Whiteboard notes
  - Collaboration status
- **Optimized Selectors**: Efficient re-rendering with targeted state updates

### 5. **Connectors & Relationships**
- **Visual Routes**: Blue lines connecting related nodes
- **Route Types**: Support for different connection types (route, dependency, timeline)
- **Animated Connections**: Smooth visual flow between trip elements

## üöÄ How to Use

### **Accessing the Map Workspace**
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/board/[id]` to access the map workspace
2. The map loads with sample data showing the new features

### **Adding Nodes**

- **Use the + button** in the bottom right to add nodes at the center
- **Drag from whiteboard** to create nodes from brainstorming notes

### **Editing Nodes**
- **Click on any node** to select it
- **Click the expand button** to see full details
- **Click the edit button** to modify information
- **Use action buttons** for quick actions

### **Whiteboard Features**
- **Click the Layers button** to open the whiteboard
- **Add notes** with different types and colors
- **Drag notes around** to organize ideas
- **Double-click notes** to drop them onto the map

### **Collaboration**
- **Click "Start Collaboration"** to enable real-time features
- **Share button** to copy board links
- **Export button** to download board data

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### **Components Created**
- `MapWorkspace.tsx` - Main map container with Mapbox integration
- `PreviewCard.tsx` - Floating info cards for trip nodes
- `WhiteboardDrawer.tsx` - Side panel for creative planning
- `mapStore.ts` - Zustand state management store

### **Types Defined**
- `TripNode` - Interface for trip planning nodes
- `Connection` - Interface for node relationships
- `MapViewport` - Interface for map view state
- `WhiteboardNote` - Interface for whiteboard notes

### **Dependencies Added**
- `react-map-gl` - React wrapper for Mapbox GL JS
- `mapbox-gl` - Mapbox GL JS library
- `zustand` - State management
- `react-sketch-canvas` - Drawing capabilities

## üé® Design Features

### **Visual Design**
- **Dark Theme**: Matches the futuristic city map aesthetic
- **Floating Cards**: Elevated appearance with shadows and blur effects
- **Smooth Animations**: Transitions and hover effects
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on different screen sizes

### **User Experience**
- **Intuitive Controls**: Clear buttons and interactions
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover states, selection indicators
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Efficient workflow support
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## üîß Configuration

### **Environment Variables**
Add to `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here
```

### **Mapbox Setup**
1. Sign up at [mapbox.com](https://mapbox.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy your access token
4. Add it to your environment variables

## üöß Future Enhancements

### **Planned Features**
- **Real-time Collaboration**: WebSocket integration for live updates
- **Advanced Drawing**: More drawing tools and shapes
- **Route Optimization**: Automatic route planning between nodes
- **Export Formats**: PDF, image, and other export options
- **Mobile Support**: Touch-optimized interactions

### **Integration Opportunities**
- **Calendar Integration**: Sync with trip dates
- **Booking Integration**: Direct booking from nodes
- **Weather Integration**: Real-time weather data
- **Social Features**: Share and collaborate on boards

## üì± Usage Examples

### **Creating a Trip Itinerary**
1. Open the map workspace
2. Add lodging nodes by clicking on hotel locations
3. Add restaurant nodes for dining options
4. Add activity nodes for attractions
5. Use the whiteboard to brainstorm additional ideas
6. Connect related nodes with routes
7. Export or share your completed itinerary

### **Collaborative Planning**
1. Start collaboration mode
2. Share the board link with travel companions
3. Everyone can add and edit nodes in real-time
4. Use the whiteboard for group brainstorming
5. Finalize the itinerary together

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the travel planning features while maintaining the existing codebase structure and design patterns.
